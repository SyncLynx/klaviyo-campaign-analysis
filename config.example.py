# Timeframe for Statistics
# NOTE: The script uses "last_30_days" for fetching campaign statistics
# Valid options: today, yesterday, this_week, last_7_days, last_week, this_month,
#                last_30_days, last_month, last_90_days, last_3_months,

# The MONTHS_BACK setting above filters which campaigns to fetch, but statistics
# are always pulled using the timeframe below (hardcoded as last_30_days in the script)

# Rate Limiting
RATE_LIMIT_DELAY = 1.0  # Delay between API calls in seconds (1 request/sec, increase if you still hit rate limits)
